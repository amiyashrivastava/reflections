Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: In big projects, where more than one developer are involved, it's better to keep the work on a remote server than on a local machine. That way the code base is accessible to everyone and at the same time you can keep your unfinished work on your local repository.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: It may so happen that other developers have update the same piece of code that I am working on and eventhough I am aware that they have done so, I am not ready yet to merge their changes with mine, and therefore, I want these changes to wait until I am ready else, the system will edit the file that I don't want it to edit at all.
